                <h2>Generative AI Project</h2>
                <p class="p">My brother Lawrence and I explored the mathematical reasoning abilities of generative AI tools and conducted large-scale surveys to understand how our community perceived them. We presented our findings to the school district and played a key role in forming the district's AI committee, successfully advocating for student access to these tools for educational use.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p">Our project earned first place in both the state of Kansas and the South Central region, and ultimately won the <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2024/07/24/lvs-national-stem-competition/" target="_blank" class="a">2024 eCYBERMISSION National STEM Competition</a> in the 8th grade division.</p>

                <h2>AI Monitoring in Schools</h2>
                <p class="p">Lawrence and I investigated the effectiveness and impact of AI-powered student monitoring tools used in our school district. To better understand community perspectives, we conducted large-scale surveys that revealed important concerns and expectations. We advocated for a balanced, transparent, and well-regulated approach to the use of these technologies, emphasizing that students—being the primary subjects of monitoring—deserve a voice in how such tools are implemented.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p">Our project earned first place in both the state of Kansas and the South Central region, and we were honored to be named national finalists in the <a href="https://ecybermission.blogspot.com/2025/05/meet-2025-national-finalists.html" target="_blank" class="a">2025 eCYBERMISSION STEM Competition</a> for the 9th grade division.</p>

                <h2>Plastic Project</h2>
                <p class="p">My team developed a model to quantify the amount of plastic in our municipal waste and investigated plastic recycling practices in our district. We also conducted a large-scale survey to understand community perceptions of disposable plastic shopping bags in our city. We presented our findings to the <a href="https://lawrenceks.civicweb.net/document/121148/Written_Public_Comment.pdf?handle=CD2C8A4F26034DECB3ECDC3DA8935C83" target="_blank" class="a">Lawrence Sustainability Board</a>, which helped contribute to the decision to eliminate plastic bags at retail locations.</p>
