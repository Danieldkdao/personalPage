        <h2>Guitar Tools Application</h2>
        <p class="p">This project is an interactive website designed to help guitarists improve their skills through a suite of practice tools. The site features custom-built utilities aimed at sharpening essential guitar techniques like strumming, scale practice, and chord recognition.</p>

        <h2>Message Encryption Decryption</h2>
        <p class="p">This project is a simple web-based encryption and decryption tool. It lets users securely encode messages using a randomized substitution cipher, and then decode them using the same key. The interface is clean and user-friendly, with a toggle switch that lets users switch between encryption and decryption modes. A dynamic “Reset Key” button shuffles the character mapping, allowing for a new encryption scheme each time — ensuring that every message is uniquely encoded.</p>

        <h2>Jazz</h2>
        <p class="p">I've been learning guitar for about three years now, and this summer I went to the Coleman Hawkins Jazz Camp. It was a really fun experience — I met some great friends, played a lot of music, and learned so much from the instructors and other musicians. It helped me grow a lot as a guitarist and made me even more excited to keep practicing and improving.</p>
