                <h2>Generative AI Project</h2>
                <p class="p">My brother Lawrence and I explored the mathematical reasoning abilities of generative AI tools and conducted large-scale surveys to understand how our community perceived them. We presented our findings to the school district and played a key role in forming the district's AI committee, successfully advocating for student access to these tools for educational use.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p">Our project earned first place in both the state of Kansas and the South Central region, and ultimately won the <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2024/07/24/lvs-national-stem-competition/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color:blue;">2024 eCYBERMISSION National STEM Competition</a> in the 8th grade division.</p>

                <h2>AI Monitoring in Schools</h2>
                <p class="p">Lawrence and I investigated the effectiveness and impact of AI-powered student monitoring tools used in our school district. To better understand community perspectives, we conducted large-scale surveys that revealed important concerns and expectations. We advocated for a balanced, transparent, and well-regulated approach to the use of these technologies, emphasizing that students—being the primary subjects of monitoring—deserve a voice in how such tools are implemented.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="p">Our project earned first place in both the state of Kansas and the South Central region, and we were honored to be named national finalists in the <a href="https://ecybermission.blogspot.com/2025/05/meet-2025-national-finalists.html" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">2025 eCYBERMISSION STEM Competition</a> for the 9th grade division.</p>
