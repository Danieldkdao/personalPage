            <h2>Our Business</h2>
            <p>My brother Lawrence and I won first place in the <a href="https://lawrencekstimes.com/2025/02/10/2025-dgco-yec/" class="a">2025 Douglas County Youth Entrepreneurship Challenge</a> with our business, <a href="https://dontpanicaitutors.github.io/index.html" class="a">“Don’t Panic AI Tutors,”</a> which offers tutoring and workshops to help students understand AI, spark curiosity, and build the skills they’ll need in a tech-driven world. Our mission is to make AI education fun, accessible, and empowering. We later competed at the <a href="https://networkkansas.com/student-innovators-take-the-spotlight-at-the-2025-kansas-entrepreneurship-challenge/" class="a">2025 Kansas Entrepreneurship Challenge</a>, hosted by Network Kansas, where we received the Exemplary Award — the highest honor at the competition. That recognition inspired us to keep growing our project.</p>
